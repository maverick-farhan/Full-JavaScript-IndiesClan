//Variable Declaration
var firstName;
//Variable Definition

//Both at same time (i.e Declaration and Definition at the same time)

//Three ways to declare variables
let typesOfVariables =['var','let','const']


//Hoisting
yourName = 'Replace this text with Your Name'
console.log('Hi '+ yourName+' .This is hoisting when declaration went top of definition at the time of execution in Javascript')

//Variable naming rules
console.log('Variables naming rules:')
console.log('(1) First letter should be either $ or underscore or alphabets but not numbers, special characters. For Example: \n ')
console.log('Correct Names: ')
console.log('_coreJS,firstName,your_age,number1,$name')

console.log('Wrong Names: ')
console.log('1number,#myName,first-name')

console.log('Javascript well known convention for naming variables is camelCase')
console.log('These are camelCase')
console.log('firstName,lastName,isOver,doThis,notThis')

//Variable Scopes (Block level, Function level, Global level)
